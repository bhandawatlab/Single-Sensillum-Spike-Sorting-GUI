% hopkins Function for calculating the Hopkins statistics
% Implementation of the Hopkins statistics
%      (cf. "A New Method for determining the Type of Distribution of Plant
%       Individuals.", B. Hopkins and J. G. Skellam, 1954)
%
% Inputs:
%    data: nxd matrix where n = number of observations, d = number of
%    dimensions
%    m: number of points to use (m<<n)
%    type: 'Norm' = normal data
%          'Prob' = probability distribution

% Outputs:
%    H: hopkins statistic
%    window: hyperrectangle bounds (d x 2 matrix)
